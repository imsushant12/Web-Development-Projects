            Thankyou for showing interest, here is a quick story of me and this website. 
            My programming journey started back in 2019, few months before I started studying CSE in LNCT
            Bhopal.
            I am currently in my second year and doing Technical Content Writing Internship at GeeksForGeeks. I
            like coding all kind of problems from the very basic like adding numbers to the complex ones like competitive 
            programming problems. I love making projects and games. Infact this website is one of my Web Development 
            Projects which is built using HTML and CSS.
